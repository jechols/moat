# MOAT: Mock orcid API Thing

Build a moat to test out authentication (and other tasks) without the pain of
the orcid.org sandbox!

**Note**: this is 100% untested and written by Gemini. Don't expect the code to
look good. Don't expect the app to do what it claims. This is just a test to
see if we can do local dev against an easy-to-use *local* API.
