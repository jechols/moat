# MOAT: Mock orcid API Thing

Build a moat to test out authentication (and other tasks) without the pain of
the orcid.org sandbox!

**Note**: this is not well-tested and written almost entirely by Gemini. Don't
expect the code to look good. Don't use it as an example of best practices.
Don't expect the app to do what it claims. This is just a test to see if we can
do local dev against an easy-to-use *local* API.
